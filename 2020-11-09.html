          <blockquote class="blockquote">"[insert generic election analysis lifted directly from major media outlets]" - every single person you know</blockquote>

          <p>Well, folks, another four years, another presidential election come and gone. In many ways, this one was just like all the others. (If you're not so sure about that, though, consider things from the point of view of "marginal differentiation," which teaches us that the more that two apparently opposing sides exaggerate their differences from one another, the more similar they, in all actuality, are. Think Coke vs. Pepsi, Burger King vs. McDonald's, Duke vs. UNC. On the other hand, things which are actually quite different from one another, like cooks and pilots, never seem to feel the need to bring it up.) Admittedly, however, this one did get a little more confusing than some of the others. And that's probably because you're not very <i>informed</i>.</p>

          <p>You see, it's quite important to be <i>informed</i>. If you are <i>informed</i>, for instance, you will probably vote, and when you do so, you will probably do it correctly. Being <i>informed</i> also provides you with a nice sense of moral superiority, and helps to pick up chicks. All around, being <i>informed</i> is doubleplusgood.</p>

          <p>Lucky for you, we here at the WMT are more <i>informed</i> maybe than we've ever been, and we're here to help you make sense of this complicated election cycle. And why was this election cycle so complicated? Well, we can basically break it down into two component parts: the Senate and the Presidential election.

          <p>Let's start with the Senate. Over on Capitol Hill last week, we found ourselves trapped, Lewinsky-like, in the political equivalent of Gobbler's Knob. It seems that, because certain sitting and would-be senators emerged from their holes and saw their own shadows, we are guaranteed six more weeks of winter elections. Now, <i>during that time</i>, the House is going to attempt to take back the Senate by filibustering and flipping seats. If the House can force a party-line vote, the issue will get remanded back to--you guessed it--the Senate itself. (That is, of course, assuming that the vote doesn't fall within the marginal error, which would then trigger an immediate run-off. This is exactly what happened in Georgia.) Now, in any tie between the House and the Senate, the stalemate can be broken <i>by any U.S. Vice President, past, present, or future</i>. The first VP to make it through the doors of the Senate and onto the floor wins the right to cast the tie-breaking vote. (You may have heard this referred to as "first past the post," and it's also basically the plot of the political thriller <i>Rat Race</i>.) This year, the Democrats are especially well positioned to cast that tie-breaking vote, as they have both former vice president Joe Biden('s husband) and future vice president Kamala Harris active in this year's race. Democrats Mondale and Gore will also look on from the sidelines, inflating their numbers to four. Republicans, with Quayle, Cheney, and Pence, have at best three contenders. (That's because Cheney's status as VP is itself dubious, given the near unanimous consensus amongst high school sophomores in 2006 that it was Dick Cheney, and not George W. Bush, who ran the country.) Contestants will race to the Senate floor inside of an NBA-style bubble, and will be tested daily for the coronavirus. (It's also rumored that Joe Biden('s husband), given his advanced age, plans to use Harris as a "pinch runner," which basically puts the weight doubly on her shoulders to secure the legislative branch. This is what's commonly known as the "bikamala legislature," and it's a major feature of American democracy that the Founding Fathers envisioned when they created our country and its system of government!)</p>

          <p>And as if <i>that's</i> not enough, we've also got to settle the subject of this presidential election! We always knew this one was going to be close, but following the 2016 election, voting isolationists basically ensured the mess we have today by hastily severing ties with Russian and Chinese election enthusiasts. International involvement in American elections had been a time-honored tradition; of course we were going to get things wrong the first time we tried to do it on our own! You have to walk before you can run, but boy, did we stumble.</p>

          <p>So now we've got ourselves a disputed election. As you may remember from the year 2000, disputed elections typically occur when two conditions are met: 1) dire, hysterical predictions of some cataclysmic apocalypse fail to come true; and, 2) the election takes place between two candidates who, at the time of the election, seem poised to lead the country in two radically different directions on the basis of their apparently diametrically opposed views, but who will later eventually just kind of show up places once in awhile and sometimes be the butts of the jokes. And, as only gypsy precogs such as the soothsayer Nate Silver were able to see coming, these two conditions were in fact met this time around.</p>

          <p>So, what happens now? Well, as we all know from 2000, typically a disputed presidential election is decided (as the result of a series of handshake deals in smoke-filled rooms) by the brother of the Republican candidate. Are you starting to see where things get tricky? With both of Donald Trump's brothers deceased, there is no one to cast the vote in his favor. Although there is no precedent for this, legal scholars who have devoted their careers to this and my <i>informed</i> colleagues who read about it on their Twitter feeds while using the bathroom predict that the deciding vote will then be transferred, in a <i>Family Feud-style</i> "chance to steal," to Joe Biden('s husband)'s brother. <i>But which brother?</i> Biden has two, and the vote could go to either. Although the natural assumption would be that either would, of course, vote for brother Joe, neither has a voting record, so it's hard to run on. If one of those brothers was to lose faith in Joe--to become a "faithless elector," so to speak--then anything could happen. The decision of which brother gets the vote could ultimately make its way to the Supreme Court, which would rule under <i>stare decisis</i>--the legal principle of determining points of litigation relating to presidents. There is a question, of course, as to whether any of this will be admissible, but these are natural issues involved in the discovery associated with any case.</p>

          <p>So, there you have it. We'll be keeping ourselves <i>informed</i> as the situation unfolds, and we'll be sure to let you know if we come up with any other important explanations for the most important political goings-on of our time (at least, until the next political going-on of our time)!</p>
    
          <h2 class="section-heading">And now, onto the show...</h2>

          <p><u>"two reverse" by Adrianne Lenker</u></p>
         
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">Adrianne Lenker, best known for fronting Big Thief, has recently started releasing solo music, and this track (the opener to 2020's songs) is one which really grabbed us. A ballad driven by intricate, vaguely dissonant, and at-times-finger-picked strings, it feels like Big Thief (duh) meets Joanna Newsom meets recent Tallest Man on Earth. It's beautiful but melancholic, peaceful but with a touch of quiet frenzy to it, too. You best believe that this track is going to kick off on our part an exploration of more of Lenker's solo work.</p>

          <p><u>"faith healer" by Julien Baker</u></p>
         
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">We've been big fans of Julien Baker ever since she burst onto the scene with 2015's <i>Sprained Ankle</i>. (If you haven't already, listen to that whole record straight through, but if you must pick favorites, we recommend the eponymous "Sprained Ankle," "Everybody Does," "Something," and the elegiac "Go Home." Like Justin Vernon and Kristian Matsson, Baker's got a thing for ending guitar records with piano tracks.)</p>

          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">Like Phoebe Bridgers (with whom she collabs in the form of Boygenius), Baker is following up soft-spoken success with louder, more electric efforts. And although "faith healer" definitely retains a lot of the beauty of Baker's earlier work, "louder" is definitely the right word--the track is, at times, downright cacophonous (relative, of course, to Baker's other work). This song feels more confident than anything else she's released before. We look forward to seeing where that goes.</p>

          <p><u>"Killing Floor" by Emma Ruth Rundle, Thou</u></p>
         
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">The first track on this week's list to receive proper capitalization, "Killing Floor" is a little different from the usual fare on the WMT. It opens with nearly a minute of spectral, synthy tones which sort of evoke Disintegration-era The Cure or William Basinki's Disintegration Loops. At nearly the one minute mark, however, we break into a synthy, sludgy, metallic lurching sort of drone which creeps its way along for the next five or so minutes. We're not sure if this one will stick or not, but it's a really cool track (and the cover art for the record is really cool).</p>

          <p><u>"Television Romance" by Pale Waves</u></p>
         
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">The title and band name alone were almost enough to land this track on the WMT. Come on, look at 'em--you just knew this was going to be up our alley.</p>

          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">"Television Romance" is an instant banger. Even before you've heard the chorus, you know it's going to be an infectious synth pop dance anthem. It's got that organic, unsophisticated synth sexiness of, for example, a "Kim and Jessie" or a "Graveyard Girl" or a "Hearts Like Ours." In all of these cases, what makes the refrain captivating is less its lyrical content and much more some sort of guitar and/or keys hook, and the same is true here. (That being said, repeating the phrase "television romance" over and over again has its own intoxicating adolescent import.)</p>
          
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">This song is like the soundtrack to some imagined, less affecting prequel to <i>Bright Lights, Big City</i></p>

          <p><u>"Wheels Roll Home" by the Antlers</u></p>
         
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">What? Yes. New music from The Antlers--this is exciting stuff.</p>

          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">As you may or may not recall, The Antlers released the single greatest album of all time in 2009's <i>Hospice</i>. Seriously. If this hasn't affected you, take the next 18-24 months and listen to it almost exclusively, just like we did. Not impressed on first listen? Okay. Join the club. Listen to it a second time. "Oh, yeah, I guess 'Bear' and 'Two' are pretty good." Oh, do you? Listen to it a third time. "Oh Sylvia is kind of cool, too, I guess." That so? Do it again and again and again until you begin to realize that every single moment of that record is more important than the most important moment of your life. But that's okay, because by that time, every single moment of that record will be a moment of your life, too.</p>

          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">At any rate, after Hospice, The Antlers went on to release <i>Burst Apart</i> (2011), <i>Undersea</i> (2012), and <i>Familiars</i> (2014). Then, tragically, they stopped making music. In March of last year, however, rumors surfaced that they were recording again, and last week frontman Pete Silberbro and drummer Michael Lerner released the single "Wheels Roll Home." Per Silberdude, "'Wheels Roll Home' is a simple song about the hopeful promise of reunion after a long time gone. It's that feeling of finding home in someone, eager and impatient to build a life together. It's the experience of waiting out tumultuous times, longing for stability someday." As Timothee Chalamet might say, "ca fait longtemps."</p>
       
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">As far as the track itself goes, it's very <i>Undersea/Familiars</i>-wave, but we're not complaining. We're looking forward to the full-length. In the meantime, as the temperature continues to go down, we plan on spending yet another winter--our twelfth straight--with <i>Hospice</i>.</p>
         
          <p><u>"Trust Me" by Sincere Engineer</u></p>
         
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">For more on Sincere Engineer, check out this week's <i>Up the Punx</i> installment below.</p>

          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">As for this track in particular, "Trust Me" is a 2020 single which we hope heralds the appearance of a full-length (or at least a few more singles) on the horizon. This is a little darker and more emo-informed than Sincere Engineer's earlier works, and the production is certainly more polished as well. To be frank, we'd actually recommend starting with 2017's <i>Rhombithian</i> (just see below already!) and then coming back to this emo banger. But you really can't go wrong--these guys make very solid garage punk music.</p>
          
          <p>**********************************************************************************************</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">From the Vault</h2>

          <p>This week, we open up the vault to bring you, courtesy of the Brothers Paderewski, Anohni's "Drone Bomb Me." Playing on seductive love song tropes, Anohni's Obama-era drone strike anthem takes the POV of a 9-year-old who has lost her entire family to drone strikes, and finally wishes to be taken in similar fashion herself. If that sounds heavy--and it is--then try and wrap your head around the fact that it's also kind of a banger.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">We're Still Listening To</h2>

          <p>Now, Now's "SGL" (like, all week), Rhye's "Open"</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">Up the Punx</h2>

          <p>Up above, we recommended some recent Sincere Engineer, so this seems like a good place to bring up 2017's <i>Rhombithian</i>. This one is sort of a Mugwump-fi, rough-around-the-edges garage punk record with hints of early Alkaline Trio and Lawrence Arms (which shouldn't come as a surprise, as Sincere Engineer are also from Chicago). In some of the album's more produced moments, you might catch whiffs of Jersey punk as well, like early Gaslight Anthem, but these are fleeting and hard to hold in your hands for any meaningful length of time. If you're at all punk-inclined, this is a really good, really listenable record that we'd recommend checking out. And even if you haven't been punk-inclined, this could be a good place to start. And "Overbite" resonates with us, for obvious reasons from both childhood and its end.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%;color: rgb(142, 47, 231);">Audience Participation Round</h2>

          <p>This week, we invite <i>informed</i> audience members to provide their own <i>informed</i> explanations of complicated phenomena to the rest of the thread. The barristers in our midst, for instance, might choose to provide an <i>informed</i> explanation on the clinical trials surrounding the coronavirus, or our creatives might choose to provide an analysis of the market response to the rumors of Janet Yellen at Treasury. Bonus points for any buzzwords you use. Your <i>informed</i> explanation should sound utterly ridiculous to anyone actually familiar with the field, but should be written in such a way that a layperson couldn't tell you from an expert.</p>
