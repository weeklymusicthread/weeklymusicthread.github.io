          <blockquote class="blockquote">"[insert generic election analysis lifted directly from major media outlets]" - every single person you know</blockquote>

          <p>Well, folks, another four years, another presidential election come and gone. In many ways, this one was just like all the others. (If you're not so sure about that, though, consider things from the point of view of "marginal differentiation," which teaches us that the more that two apparently opposing sides exaggerate their differences from one another, the more similar they, in all actuality, are. Think Coke vs. Pepsi, Burger King vs. McDonald's, Duke vs. UNC. On the other hand, things which are actually quite different from one another, like cooks and pilots, never seem to feel the need to bring it up.) Admittedly, however, this one did get a little more confusing than some of the others. And that's probably because you're not very <i>informed</i>.</p>

          <p>You see, it's quite important to be <i>informed</i>. If you are <i>informed</i>, for instance, you will probably vote, and when you do so, you will probably do it correctly. Being <i>informed</i> also provides you with a nice sense of moral superiority, and helps to pick up chicks. All around, being <i>informed</i> is doubleplusgood.</p>

          <p>Lucky for you, we here at the WMT are more <i>informed</i> maybe than we've ever been, and we're here to help you make sense of this complicated election cycle. And why was this election cycle so complicated? Well, we can basically break it down into two component parts: the Senate and the Presidential election.

          <p>Let's start with the Senate. Over on Capitol Hill last week, we found ourselves trapped, Lewinsky-like, in the political equivalent of Gobbler's Knob. It seems that, because certain sitting and would-be senators emerged from their holes and saw their own shadows, we are guaranteed six more weeks of winter elections. Now, <i>during that time</i>, the House is going to attempt to take back the Senate by filibustering and flipping seats. If the House can force a party-line vote, the issue will get remanded back to--you guessed it--the Senate itself. (That is, of course, assuming that the vote doesn't fall within the marginal error, which would then trigger an immediate run-off. This is exactly what happened in Georgia.) Now, in any tie between the House and the Senate, the stalemate can be broken <i>by any U.S. Vice President, past, present, or future</i>. The first VP to make it through the doors of the Senate and onto the floor wins the right to cast the tie-breaking vote. (You may have heard this referred to as "first past the post," and it's also basically the plot of the political thriller <i>Rat Race</i>.) This year, the Democrats are especially well positioned to cast that tie-breaking vote, as they have both former vice president Joe Biden('s husband) and future vice president Kamala Harris active in this year's race. Democrats Mondale and Gore will also look on from the sidelines, inflating their numbers to four. Republicans, with Quayle, Cheney, and Pence, have at best three contenders. (That's because Cheney's status as VP is itself dubious, given the near unanimous consensus amongst high school sophomores in 2006 that it was Dick Cheney, and not George W. Bush, who ran the country.) Contestants will race to the Senate floor inside of an NBA-style bubble, and will be tested daily for the coronavirus. (It's also rumored that Joe Biden('s husband), given his advanced age, plans to use Harris as a "pinch runner," which basically puts the weight doubly on her shoulders to secure the legislative branch. This is what's commonly known as the "bikamala legislature," and it's a major feature of American democracy that the Founding Fathers envisioned when they created our country and its system of government!)</p>

          <p>And as if <i>that's</i> not enough, we've also got to settle the subject of this presidential election! We always knew this one was going to be close, but following the 2016 election, voting isolationists basically ensured the mess we have today by hastily severing ties with Russian and Chinese election enthusiasts. International involvement in American elections had been a time-honored tradition; of course we were going to get things wrong the first time we tried to do it on our own! You have to walk before you can run, but boy, did we stumble.</p>

          <p>So now we've got ourselves a disputed election. As you may remember from the year 2000, disputed elections typically occur when two conditions are met: 1) dire, hysterical predictions of some cataclysmic apocalypse fail to come true; and, 2) the election takes place between two candidates who, at the time of the election, seem poised to lead the country in two radically different directions on the basis of their apparently diametrically opposed views, but who will later eventually just kind of show up places once in awhile and sometimes be the butts of the jokes. And, as only gypsy precogs such as the soothsayer Nate Silver were able to see coming, these two conditions were in fact met this time around.</p>

          <p>So, what happens now? Well, as we all know from 2000, typically a disputed presidential election is decided (as the result of a series of handshake deals in smoke-filled rooms) by the brother of the Republican candidate. Are you starting to see where things get tricky? With both of Donald Trump's brothers deceased, there is no one to cast the vote in his favor. Although there is no precedent for this, legal scholars who have devoted their careers to this and my <i>informed</i> colleagues who read about it on their Twitter feeds while using the bathroom predict that the deciding vote will then be transferred, in a <i>Family Feud-style</i> "chance to steal," to Joe Biden('s husband)'s brother. <i>But which brother?</i> Biden has two, and the vote could go to either. Although the natural assumption would be that either would, of course, vote for brother Joe, neither has a voting record, so it's hard to run on. If one of those brothers was to lose faith in Joe--to become a "faithless elector," so to speak--then anything could happen. The decision of which brother gets the vote could ultimately make its way to the Supreme Court, which would rule under <i>stare decisis</i>--the legal principle of determining points of litigation relating to presidents. There is a question, of course, as to whether any of this will be admissible, but these are natural issues involved in the discovery associated with any case.</p>

          <p>So, there you have it. We'll be keeping ourselves <i>informed</i> as the situation unfolds, and we'll be sure to let you know if we come up with any other important explanations for the most important political goings-on of our time (at least, until the next political going-on of our time)!</p>

          <hr>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">From the Vault</h2>

          <p>This week, we open up the vault to bring you, courtesy of the Brothers Paderewski, Anohni's "Drone Bomb Me." Playing on seductive love song tropes, Anohni's Obama-era drone strike anthem takes the POV of a 9-year-old who has lost her entire family to drone strikes, and finally wishes to be taken in similar fashion herself. If that sounds heavy--and it is--then try and wrap your head around the fact that it's also kind of a banger.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">We're Still Listening To</h2>

          <p>Now, Now's "SGL" (like, all week), Rhye's "Open"</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">Up the Punx</h2>

          <p>Up above, we recommended some recent Sincere Engineer, so this seems like a good place to bring up 2017's <i>Rhombithian</i>. This one is sort of a Mugwump-fi, rough-around-the-edges garage punk record with hints of early Alkaline Trio and Lawrence Arms (which shouldn't come as a surprise, as Sincere Engineer are also from Chicago). In some of the album's more produced moments, you might catch whiffs of Jersey punk as well, like early Gaslight Anthem, but these are fleeting and hard to hold in your hands for any meaningful length of time. If you're at all punk-inclined, this is a really good, really listenable record that we'd recommend checking out. And even if you haven't been punk-inclined, this could be a good place to start. And "Overbite" resonates with us, for obvious reasons from both childhood and its end.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%;color: rgb(142, 47, 231);">Audience Participation Round</h2>

          <p>This week, we invite <i>informed</i> audience members to provide their own <i>informed</i> explanations of complicated phenomena to the rest of the thread. The barristers in our midst, for instance, might choose to provide an <i>informed</i> explanation on the clinical trials surrounding the coronavirus, or our creatives might choose to provide an analysis of the market response to the rumors of Janet Yellen at Treasury. Bonus points for any buzzwords you use. Your <i>informed</i> explanation should sound utterly ridiculous to anyone actually familiar with the field, but should be written in such a way that a layperson couldn't tell you from an expert.</p>
