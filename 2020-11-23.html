          <blockquote class="blockquote">"Give a man a drum set, and he'll be a drum set for a day. But *teach* a man to drum set, and he'll be a drum set for the rest of his life." - J.K. Simmons</blockquote>

          <p>And now, for the latest installment in <i>The Adventures of Johnny Drumsticks!</i></p>

          <p>There was a time before all of this when young Johnny--being, of course, younger then--held aspirations away from the sciences and towards the arts, and held not pipettes between his fingers, but drumsticks. Yes, yes, you read that correctly: before he became an aspiring scientist, our hero was a practitioner of an altogether different sort. He was a technician of the trap set, a researcher of rhythm, a poindexter of percussion. It's true, ladies and gentlemen. Our present future Nobel Prize winner was not always such; he was at first a future Grammy winner.</p>

          <p>But the life of a future Grammy winner is hard, and it requires much practice, and so practice our hero did. He practiced, and he played, and when he played, he did so in loose confederation with a chameleon cast of characters who assembled themselves into iterations and reiterations of each other like the rosters of certain sports teams on consecutive seasons. The names of these groups were chimeric--nonsense phrases which invited audience members to read in meanings which were not there (and which group members themselves were not, in fact, capable of generating). "Straight Communist." "Aural Stimulation." "The Wise Janitors." To paraphrase the daughter Capulet, wtf was going on w/ these names? Nothing, in fact. Nothing at all. The names of these groups were as bereft of meaning as the music they made.</p>

          <p>Even to label them as "groups" implies a sense of organization and purpose which wasn't there. And that's because they weren't organizations so much as they were ideas. (You know, like antifa.) So then how did our hero improve his way toward that eventual Grammy nod?</p>

          <p>Well, in large part, he didn't, which is in large part why he is where he is today. But before that prognosis became clear, he sought mentorship. He set out to study at the foot pedals of some of the craft's more seasoned practitioners, which is how he found himself in a series of bizarre encounters with aging musicians which ultimately convinced him that a life outside of the arts might not be such a bad idea after all.</p>

          <p>First there was the teacher who responded inappropriately to each and every greeting. That's not to say that he was lewd or made remarks which were otherwise beyond the pale, but rather that his responses were simply incongruent with the greetings to which they were responding. If you asked him how he was doing, for instance, he would reply with a "not much." If you asked him what was up, you could expect a "good." And if you told him it was good to see him, he would say that he couldn't complain. Was this simply compensation for hearing damage? Had decades of drumming damaged his ears to the point that he couldn't actually hear what you were saying, and so he was simply guessing at responses? Not likely. First of all, he was perfectly adept at responding to any other sort of question, which suggests that the issue was limited to greetings. Moreover, given a large enough sample size, you'd expect him to occasionally respond appropriately, but over the course of years, he never once did. How do you explain that? Our hero, it turns out, never could.</p>

          <p>And so we move to the next teacher, a man with a successful past in the industry who had worked with major acts to cut famous records. Unfortunately, as he for some reason volunteered during a session, he had celebrated those successes by cutting something else: lines of narcotics on top of the vinyl records themselves. Needles to say, he did not last long.</p>

          <p>The pendulum then did as pendulums do, and swung in the opposite direction. The next teacher was squeaky clean, and taught our hero that you didn't need to do those sorts of things to succeed in the music industry. No, he taught, you can get around that stuff with a few simple tricks. "For example, any time you go to a concert, bring a bunch of orange soda. Any time someone tries to get you to drink a beer, tell them no, and then bet them you can finish your orange soda before they finish their beer!" It would not be possible to overstate how bizarre and convoluted this strategy seemed to our hero, even at a time when he was young, inexperienced, and not particularly sociable. For one thing, fluids are heavy--it's why we can't just ship in tons of water to remote places that could use it--and carting around large, unspecified amounts of orange soda all the time would be costly in terms of cash as well as energy. And how much orange soda would you need, anyway? And would this really work? Would a stranger who was bent on forcing alcohol down your throat really accept orange soda as an alternative? Our hero couldn't imagine that this was simply about fluid intake or hydration. Could this strategy backfire? Could you, in other words, get your ass kicked? It seemed like you could. Add to all of this that this advice, too, was unsolicited, and another mentor bit the dust.</p>
    
          <p>Finally, our hero found a drum teacher with no apparent substance-related baggage. Even better, this mentor was one with an eye toward the future, and insisted on adaptability if you wanted a career in a rapidly changing marketplace like the music industry. "Johnny," he told our hero, "the future is synthetic. Everyone is afraid of drum machines--they're gonna put us out of work, they think. But you can't be afraid. You've just got to adapt. Learn how to play electronic music. Learn how to play hip hop." Fair enough. And our hero did. He and his teacher together picked hip hop albums, listened to them, learned the drum parts, and reinterpreted them organically on brick-and-mortar drum kits. But here we find another hang-up. "I've been listening to this music you're sending me, Johnny," he told our hero. "And the beats, they're sick. They really are. Unfortunately, so too are these lyrics. Talkin' bout, in the club, 'how many bitches can you see?' I mean, they're talkin' bout suckin' on [bleep]s like a lollipop!" Another dumbfounding comment: syntactically off, and with a confusing lack of agreement between singulars and plural. This relationship faltered as well, and student and teacher went their separate ways. The former found his way away from music and into the Ivory Tower, and the latter started a conservative radio outlet known as the Daily Wire. (Just kidding.)</p>

          <p>And so, you see, our hero never won his Grammy. We'll see whether or not his Nobel Prize pans out. That mentorship journey, as it turns out, is a story for another day.</p>

          <p>This has been an installment in <i>The Adventures of Johnny Drumsticks!</i></p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">And now, onto the show...</h2>

          <p><u>"Empty (Dirt Road)" by Metric</u></p>
    
          <div style="float: left; clear: left; padding-right: 2em;"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7z7PeijP5wMkEWHvTrWKer" width="300" 
            height="380" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" float="right" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div>

          <p>Metric are, as an act, nearly as old as us, and yet they are also relatively unfamiliar to us. We've heard of them, of course, and they seem to be favorites of a lot of our fellow travelers, but we've never really listened to them at all.</p>

          <p>Well, in 2005, they released in album called <i>Live it Out</i>, which opened with a track called "Empty," which we've never heard before. We bring this up because, recently, they released an acoustic version of this song which came across our desk. "Empty (Dirt Road)," as this version is called, is pretty nice. It opens with a creaky, antique-y finger-picked acoustic guitar, a pretty resonant-sounding piano, and a whole lot of reverb. The track stretches and pops its' knuckles in ways that remind us of Marlon Williams' "Strange Things"--which you may recognize from the soundtrack of <i>Wild, Wild Country</i>--but without any of the creeping, old-timey eerieness of that track. Instead, what we've got here is melancholy, almost like Williams meets Jewel meets, at times, The Weakerthans.</p>

          <p>One of the things we like about this song is how long it lasts. It feels almost oppressive--it just goes on and on, and eventually resigns itself to its final, unbelieving refrain: "I'm so glad I'm an island now" [via Paul Simon and Garth Brooks].</p>
         
          <p><u>"Walking on a String (Alt. Version)" - Matt Berninger, Phoebe Bridgers</u></p>
         
          <div style="float: left; clear: left; padding-right: 2em;"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4k4VlcZtwPBDj6wx5ewzog" width="300" 
            height="380" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" float="right" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div>

          <p>Because Phoebe Bridgers is one of our favorite young artists, anything to which her name is attached is of immediate interest to us. In 2019, Bridgers collab'd with The National's Matt Berninger to record a track called "Walking on a String." They released two versions of the track--the original and the "alt version." The first one is a little more Berninger-forward, while the alt version is more Bridgers-forward, and, since we like Phoebe Bridgers more than we like The National, the alt version is our version of choice. It really sounds like it could have been a hidden track on 2018's <i>Stranger in the Alps</i>. (If, by some unfortunate turn of events you haven't yet experienced <i>SITA</i>, you've got something great coming. It's a solid listen-through, but "Motion Sickness" and "Scott Street" are early Stan Doubts.)</p>

          <p style="padding-top: 1em"><u>"Special Berry" by standards</u></p>

          <div style="float: left; clear: left; padding-right: 2em;"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6wQxjMRiJ9uqCiJSV5yAU7" width="300" 
            height="380" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" float="right" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div>

          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">Call it what you will: math rock, post-rock, whatever you want, standards is apparently an Ezra Koenig-lookin' motherfucker with a guitar, but he does a lot with it. This track reminds us a lot of Fang Island, or the happy-go-lucky younger brother to Joan of Arc, or even, at times, STS9. It's basically a single guitar riff extended to about 3 or 4 minutes and length and constantly recycled and reinterpreted according to different genres, techniques, and tempos. Think of it as an organic "Grape Soda."</p>
         
          <p style="padding-left: 2em;">This dude also has a vibe. If you check out the music video for standards, you'll note his, again, Ezra Koenig face, his cutesay fingerboard inlays, and his array of stuffed animals. It extends to the cover art for his (their?) recent record, <i>Fruit Island</i>, as well.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">From the Vault</h2>

          <p>Did you ever see Ryan Gosling's unfairly maligned directorial debut, Lost River (2014)? It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's really, really interesting and it's aesthetically special. Besides, and as Bolano articulates nicely in <i>2666</i>, perfection is severely overrated in artistic endeavors. “He chose The Metamorphosis over The Trial, he chose Bartleby over Moby-Dick, he chose A Simple Heart over Bouvard and Pecuchet, and A Christmas Carol over A Tale of Two Cities or The Pickwick Papers. What a sad paradox, thought Amalfitano. Now even bookish pharmacists are afraid to take on the great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze paths into the unknown. They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters. Or what amounts to the same thing: they want to watch the great masters spar, but they have no interest in real combat, when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and stench.” Specifically, with respect to Lost River, the lighting and the music really stood out to us. From the early ad-libbing of The Delfonics' "Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)" to "Yes (Love Theme From Lost River)" by The Chromatics, the soundtrack really worked with the atmosphere of the film. Most of all, we loved Saoirse Ronan's "Tell Me," and revisit it constantly. This week, you should, too!</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">We're Still Listening To</h2>

          <p>Francis Quinlan's "Piltdown Man," Brian Fallon's solo work, Now, Now's "SGL," Pale Waves' "Television Romance," Sincere Engineer's <i>Rhombithian</i></p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">Up the Punx</h2>

          <p>You might quibble with the inclusion of Cloud Nothings in a section on punk, but we believe that they fit here. If you doubt that, just re-visit "Stay Useless," off of 2012's <i>Attack on Memory</i>. This was a track we listened to incessantly when we first encountered it, and moving forward, we're not ruling out a regression to that sort of behavior.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%;color: rgb(142, 47, 231);">Audience Participation Round</h2>

          <p>Tell us about your most bizarre student/teacher encounters! For those of you students, what are the strangest things your teachers have done/said? For those of you students, same thing for your teachers. (And, in any of these relationships, who do you sometimes think was teaching whom?)</p>
