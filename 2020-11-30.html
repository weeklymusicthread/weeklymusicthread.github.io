          <p>We apologize for the delay in bringing you the WMT this week. Yes, we still made it in on a Monday, but it's a little bit later than usual, isn't it? Well, as it turns out, it'll have to do, because we had to see a man about a machine gun.</p>

          <p>Machine Gun Kelly, that is. Because--as we alluded to in the last installment of <i>The Adventures of Johnny Drumsticks!</i>--your hero(es) [via David Bowie] was/were once a future Grammy winner, and because his/our weapon of choice was the trap set, we grew up with a love of all things Travis Barker. Blink-182 may have faded, but Barker never did, and in addition to his recent Rogan appearance, Barker has kept busy with this new Machine Gun Kelly character.</p>
        
          <p>But who <i>is</i> Machine Gun Kelly, anyway? And, to go Young Capulet again, what of that name? At first, we figured that "Machine Gun" was a descriptor, and that she was simply one of Barker's love interests, but recent red carpet pictures put that idea to rest. Machine Gun Kelly, it turns out, is more Machine Gun than he is Kelly. But we're not done yet. There's still a lot to parse here. If "Machine Gun" is not, in fact, a descriptor, then what is it? Is it, a la a Southern belle, some sort of compound name? Like Sarah Beth, or Katie May, or Laura Jane Grace? Or is Machine his first name? And Gun is, like, his middle name? If so, what do his friends call him? Mac? Plus, if it is a first name/middle name thing, why does he insist upon using both? We typically reserve that construction for female supreme court justices and male mass shooters. (Then again, his name is Machine Gun...) Or is it the case instead that, as a fellow WMTer suggested to us over glasses of creme de menthe, the Gun-Kelly is hyphenated?
           <br> <span style = "color:rgb(8, 159, 230)">(!) These claims about Machine Gun Kelly are disputed.</span> </p>

          <p>(This, of course, brings us to a great pet peeve, which is the superfluous and, nowadays ubiquitous, hyphenation of last names. This began as a way to preserve aristocratic names which would otherwise have been lost in marriage. Machine, being presumably of the respective Houses of Gun and Kelly, known as they are to precisely no one, really has no reason to hyphenate.)
           <br> <span style = "color:rgb(8, 159, 230)">(!) Get the facts about name hyphenation.</span> </p>

          <p>All of this is made more interesting by the fact that Mac is now dating famous former Michael Bay critic Megan Fox. Should the two proceed with nuptials, Fox will presumably take (or, God forbid, hyphenate) his last name, making her Mrs. Machine Gun Kelly. Mrs. Megan "Machine Gun" Kelly. Mrs. Megan Kelly.</p>
          
          <p>Now, here's where we at the WMT can bring you the real inside information. We have it on good authority, from not one but two women who share that name with both Lady Machine Gun and famous Fox News Bombshell Megyn Kelly, that someone out there is currently making a documentary about all of the women they can find with the name Meg(h)a/yn Kell(e)y. (Seriously--this person has reached out to multiple Megans Kelly known to us.) So what if Mrs. Megan Kelly (nee Fox) pulled this entire stunt not for love, but simply to land a role in a movie whose existence we can't even confirm outside of errant hearsay among medical professionals? It turns out that Michael Bay can really ruin you, huh?
            <br> <span style = "color:rgb(8, 159, 230)">(!) This WMT violates our rules against distribution of hacked materials.</span> </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">From the Vault</h2>

          <p>At this point, we've pretty much gotta do it: this week, from the vault, we bring you Blood Orange's <i>Time Will Tell</i> (2013). We wore this record absolutely out between its release in 2013 and some point in the winter of 2017. It's worth listening to forwards to back, but if you want a taste of what you're in for, check out "Chamakay," "You're Not Good Enough," "It Is What It Is," and, of course, "Time Will Tell." (Dev Hynes of the titular citrus also wrote the excellent "All That" off of Carly Rae Jepsen's similarly excellent <i>Emotion</i> (2015).)</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">We're Still Listening To</h2>

          <p>Kitten's "Memphis" and "My House" (duh), RMR's "Rascal" and "Wishing Hour"</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%">Up the Punx</h2>

          <p>Sometimes, we lament that we sold out and went into the sciences. Then, we remember the frontman of the Descendents, Milo Aukerman, who holds a PhD in molecular biology and, between 1986 and 2016, both fronted the Descendents and worked as a scientific researcher. Check out "Suburban Home" for a taste of some classic Descendents.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading" style="font-size:125%;color: rgb(142, 47, 231);">Audience Participation Round</h2>

          <p>This week, we blindfolded ourselves and broke down our machine gun (kelly) in 90 seconds flat. (And, as Megan soon-to-be Fox-Kelly's leaked wedding vows say, "this is my machine gun. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My machine gun is my best friend...") Which celebrity stage names would you all like to break down? Ice Cube? Rip Torn? Tyler, the Creator? (That comma alone is a gold mine.) Let us know, and take it as far as you can!</p>
