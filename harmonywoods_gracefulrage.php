          <p><i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> is our first encounter with Harmony Woods. Headed up by early 20s, Philadelphia-based Sofia Verbilla, Harmony Woods has put out <i>Nothing Special</i> (2017), <i>Make Yourself at Home</i> (2019), and, not one month ago, <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> (2021). We arrived at <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> by way of Bartees Strange, who produced the record.</p>

          <p><i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> is the kind of record that holds immediate promise. From the beautiful, melancholy opening acoustic guitar lick to “Good Luck Rd.,” <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> grabs your attention, and suggests to you that it could be one of those kinds of records: the kinds of records that you hope for, that you wait for, and that, once you’ve finally found them, you listen to over and over and try to get your friends to do the same. (Consider this as us telling all our friends.) The first minute or so of “Good Luck Rd.” is, like a lonely waterfall, both serene and frantic at the same time, and this alone speaks to a talent in songwriting and composition which Verbilla will continue to display throughout the remainder of the record. But we go from suspicions of her greatness to confirmation about a minute and a half into the track. Any other songwriter might have been content to ride out the first 90 seconds of “Good Luck Rd.,” elegant and arresting as it is, indefinitely, but Verbilla displays the courage and confidence to change the song <i>entirely</i>. This is the moment when you realize that you’re in for something special, and the rest of the record does not disappoint.</p>

          <p>The front half of the record feels vaguely folk- and country-inspired. “Good Luck Rd.” and its’ follower, “Rittenhouse,” despite both being full band arrangements, grow out of “girl with a guitar” roots. (There are flashes of artists like Joanna Newsom on “Good Luck Rd.,” and Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker on “Rittenhouse.”) Even the beginning of “Easy,” the third track on the record, is chorale and ethereal, but this is also where we start to get the turn. We open on a beer- (or is it body fluid?) stained bed in either a freshman dorm room or a rundown apartment, with an implied sexual encounter that continues to haunt our narrator three years after the fact. “I thought I knew you,” Verbilla sings as the electric guitars behind her begin to growl and snarl and gnash their teeth. “Do you think you knew me?” And then things come to a head. “I should be mad at you for what you did,” Verbilla wails, “I’m mostly sad for you instead/But if you ever lay a finger on another girl again/You’ll be dead to me/You make it so easy.” The words are perfectly ambiguous: is our narrator simply a spited lover, or did something more dark and sinister take place between her and the subject of the song? It’s impossible to tell, and even the music itself gives nothing away. The chorus positively <i>throbs</i> with the chords of those guitars, lopsided as they are, like the systole and diastole of the narrator’s heartbeat as it threatens to pound out of her chest—but both love and anger can have that effect on someone’s body. If the first chorus is a throbbing heartbeat, however, the final one is a crashing, a beating, an epic, almost arena-rock climax that we can’t wait to see live one day. The name of the track is fitting, as “Easy” is easily one of the most exquisite tracks on an already exquisite record.</p>

          <p>The next track, “End,” builds to a similarly spectacular climax, and “Holding You to You,” though slower and more contemplative, has an edge to it as well. The final three tracks—“God’s Gift to Women,” the eponymous “Graceful Rage,” and “I Can’t”—come as an absolute tour-de-force. “God’s Gift to Women” is a certifiable pop-punk banger (yes, you read that correctly) from a group who have, until now, apparently not waded into such territory. You wouldn’t know it, though. The track opens with grungy guitars and cymbal crashes. “Isn’t it fun,” Verbilla yells, “picking out all the girls you want to fuck? Bell hooks on your nightstand/Dodge your girl’s messages again.” If the opening of this track is a little rough-and-tumble for you, though, stick with it until you get to the chorus, which is, somehow, a sing-along pop-punk marvel. We think it sounds like a cross between pronoun and Coheed and Cambria, which is probably why we’ve been playing it on repeat since we first heard it last night. At 2:55, it’s the shortest track on the record, but you’ll probably spend the most time listening to it, if you know what we mean.</p>

          <p>“Graceful Rage,” the title track, sums up <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i>. This is a disparate, sophisticated, and emotional affair that feels cathartic, important. It’s by turns quiet and loud, beautiful and aggressive, reflections followed by broken glass. It’s grace and rage, just like the rest of this incredible record. And it leads into “I Can’t,” which is a perfect coda to the entire experience. It starts off just like <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> itself, with an acoustic guitar and Verbilla’s reflective, contemplative ruminations. “Look at us/Who would’ve ever thought/I would leave your city for good/The two of us/I can count on one hand/The times you’ve reached out since then.” Let’s talk about that “us.” We haven’t touched on it explicitly until now, but the entirety of <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> reads like one long note that was written to one specific person—and it isn’t exactly full of warm fuzzies. Like The Antlers’ <i>Hospice</i> or parts of Phoebe Bridgers’ <i>A Stranger in the Alps</i>, Harmony Woods’ <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> comes across as a public reckoning for a private disaster that was orchestrated by a former loved one. But what happens here is more than just a break-up: there are indications strewn throughout <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> that our narrator has been taken advantage of. The extent of that is never made explicit in the lyrics, but the pain in Verbilla’s vocals, the acid in her words, and the crash and clatter of these tracks suggest that things were probably dire indeed. It is not a stretch to say that <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> is a record which lands particularly hard now, in the Me Too era. Or maybe it’s the Time’s Up era, because as much as the narrator of these songs—whether it is Verbilla herself or a character of hers—looks at her former companion, she mostly finds him looking over his shoulder. “You’ve delivered your message/A real stellar work/Not at all like the others/Those miserable jerks/You’re saying everything I’ve ever wanted to hear/But only after being told to/It’s never been more clear,” Verbilla sings in the chorus of the closer, before concluding that, “I can’t forgive you.” And later: “The whole world has bent to your/Will for so long/You’ve never been the bad guy/You’ve never been wrong/Crack my worth like a code/You thought it’d be easy/The right sequence of words/Your war strategy,” her voice straining higher and higher until falling back down for a moment. “Well I changed the locks/It’s been so long I forget when,” she climbs until finally climaxing over soaring guitars: “You will never hurt me again.” It’s the perfect example of form following content: the moment <i>feels</i> like a breakthrough, and it is. It’s the first (and, frankly, only) moment of triumph we encounter on the record, and when it finally arrives, it brings chills.</p>

          <p>There is always a little bit of risk in a topical record. For one thing, a record that feels rooted in a specific moment is always at risk of remaining rooted in <i>that specific moment</i>. And at its worst, such a record can feel like a cynical cash grab—an attempt to capitalize on something that is bigger than itself. But <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> avoids these sorts of very real pitfalls with aplomb, and we suspect that that’s because the record feels so deeply personal. When Verbilla sings, for instance, about a man who is “haunted by the past” but who “just push[es] it back,” who carries himself like “a walking fucking copy of infinite jest,” who’s “not the person the world pretends you are,” we don’t get the sense that she’s commenting on the times or speaking to some sort of universal experience; we get the sense that she is speaking to an actual, specific, living, breathing individual, that there is one person out there for whom this record is going to land much differently than it will for everyone else who listens to it. On its surface, in other words, <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> might seem like a record about some of the bad things that men do to women. And maybe it is. But it works because it at least feels very much like a record about the bad things one specific man did to one specific woman. What we’re trying to say is that the record feels authentic, and so does its sadness, its confusion, its graceful rage. </p>

          <p>By the way, we are utterly stunned to see that Harmony Woods have only about 7,500 month listeners on Spotify. Based on the strength of <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> alone, we’d expect that number to be ten times as high, and if there’s any justice at all in this world, by year’s end, it’ll be a hundred. We’ll check back in then, because we’re fairly certain that <i>GRACEFUL RAGE</i> is going to find its way onto a few “Best Of” lists around that time.</p>
