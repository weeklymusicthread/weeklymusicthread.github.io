But like a feeling of deja vu you feel in a place you're sure you've never been, it felt <i>familiar</i>.) There was something about the nonchalant vocals, the endearingly overwritten lyrics (such as \"metacarpal karaoke\"), the old attic creakiness of the acoustic guitars and drum sets, the way that the same melody evolves and changes over bars and bars (like those syncopated 16th notes we get on the guitar) but never gets very far from where it began, that felt like something we'd been listening to for a long time.",
            "Was it DeYarmond Edison? That was part of it, but not quite. This was a little too raw, alive, and youthful for that. And then it hit us: Pinegrove. It never explodes the way certain Pinegrove tracks--c.f. \"Aphasia\"--do, but all of the pieces were there. And a quick Google search revealed that, indeed, \"Remember\" is an entry from a 2017 stand alone solo EP by former Pinegrove founding member Nick Levine. (Nick is the brother of Pinegrove drummer Zack Levine, who is responsible for, among other things, the incredibly on-point and tasteful drumming in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnsiyiC0Nc0\">\"this live studio version of \"Aphasia\"\"</a>--check out 2:30 and 4:15-4:25 (that fucking cymbal choke, though...))",

This isn't as bare and cool as Sway. It's louder, broader, more of a mouthful, more earnest. The opening notes almost remind us of Love You Later's \"How Many Nights Do You Dance with Tears in Your Eyes?\" Pretty quickly, though, that plucky, ebby bass in the background is accompanied by a four-on-the-floor bass drum pattern that tells us things are going to get a little more upbeat than that. And indeed they do. Next comes a first pass at a chorus, and then a second, with more and more instrumental voices layering on. Pretty soon, the whole thing is plugging along behind a series synthy backbeat.",

Some of that's pretty cool, too.\" The record kicks off with a creaky and ethereal track, \"Jealousy,\" which as a stand-alone doesn't seem to stand for all that much (which, according to our co-workers who are really into mainstream politics, means it will fall for anything.) Where \"Jealousy\" mostly makes its money is as a lead-in to second and third tracks \"Mustang\" and \"Boomer,\" which retain some of the creakiness but up both the amplitude and the tempo. These were the two singles we were most excited about in past weeks, and they're the by far the standouts on our early listens. They've both got that National desperation that marks the best of Strange's solo tracks. After that, the record travels into Strange's third single, \"Kelly Rowland,\" which, aside from its interesting sample, never captured us as much as the other two did.",

From there, the rest of the back half of the record is much, much looser than everything that came before it. Several of the tracks are essentially just strings and vocals with synth landscapes slothing around behind them.",

You can't quite make out where different sounds are coming from, whether they'll repeat or not, whether they have anything to do with the melody at all or whether they're just window dressing.

The real standout is the eponymous \"All or Nothing.\" The song starts out with a nice enough vibe but not much to write home about--just a drowsy sad kinda chick who is, in the parlance of our times, \"all of us.\" It's not until the second verse passes and the chorus begins that things really turn up. We get a brief hiccup, and then a vaguely \"Strobe\"-like layer settles over the chorus and provides a nice bounce to the track. The other songs on this EP are all worth a listen as well. It doesn't jump out at you, necessarily, but we've found ourselves coming back to it all week.",

(The record was released back in May but we're just now discovering it for ourselves.) We've only spent a couple of days with it and therefore only given it a few full listens, but we're really excited by how both familiar and new it feels at the same time. This is evident from the opening track, \"Whole Life.\" There's a classic, timeless element to the production--it reminds you of the shaky, quivery kind of pretty songs you hear in old movies--but it also manages to sound like nothing we've heard before.",

Also, other tracks feel much more modern and forward, like \"Describe,\" which feels almost like Beck meets The Flaming Lips? We're not quite sure about that, but this track is a hipster's slow-motion entrance dream. And things just keep evolving from there. \"Without You\" is a breezy evening ditty--you can almost (we said <i>almost</i>, okay?) hear a bossa nova underneath it--and \"On the Floor\" is actually, of all things, <i>shuffle</i>. Although we probably need a lot more time with this record before we can say more, that's a chunk of time we're really looking forward to putting in.",

The first half, with its alternative guitar tuning and clean acoustic sounds, is almost reminiscent at times of mid '90s radio rock, but the second half is where things really come alive. Everything becomes distorted, muddled, electrified, and the lyrics reach a max meaningfulness level.

It was a translation of artists like Robyn, artists like Tegan and Sara, like Carly Rae Jepsen, who for years had been making chick-driven, 80's era pseudo-nostalgic synth pop, but who had committed so hard to that sound that they could not have possible broken through to arena-level mainstream fame. It is Swift's unique talent to take that sound, to soften its edges, and to turn it into, again, one of the greatest pop records of our lives.",
            "And <i>folklore</i> feels like another translation. This time, it's not Robyn, but Lana del Rey who provides the source material. Opening tracks \"the 1\" and \"cardigan\" are nice, solid stand-alone efforts, but both of them also kinda make you just wanna listen to Lana. It's the blase tone, the breathy delivery, the swung bounciness, the vocal runs and held notes fading into a reverby background, the references to youth, to women, to men, to America. This vibe breaks for a little bit around tracks 4 and 5, but shows back up in time for \"mirrorball\" and the creatively named \"seven.\" The eighth track, \"august\" (do you get it?) sems to break out of that ambien daze for a bit. Indeed, the back half of the album seems to earn the title of \"folklore\" a little more, and feels maybe like a bit of a return to some of Swift's roots. (track 14, \"betty,\" pulls in, for instance, some quiet harmonica and some lyrics about gyms and dances and him and homerooms and a subtle take on a \"Love Story\" wave key change.)",
            "The truth is, like all of Swift's efforts, this is a long record, and we'll need to spend a little more time with it. Vexingly, this is yet another late July release that feels to us like a winter record, but we wonder whether all of that has to do more with lockdowns than anything else. Cold weather and coronavirus both force musicians indoors for extended periods of time, and we as fans wind up with these beautiful elegiac efforts as a result. If it were up to us, it'd always be autumn or winter."

            "We've heard tell of this group but had never encountered their stuff before. \"What's the Matter\" is a really nice, pleasant, infectious track. It's laid back but dancey. The multiple, overlaid vocal tracks throughout give it a real sing-along feel, and the riding on the cymbal bells really contribute to accenting certain beats over others. And, on that front, the drum fills here really follow the melody, which is an interesting touch you don't see often. (It's common for the vocal melody to mimic the lead guitar/keys melody, which can be either infectious or totally annoying and dead-sounding, but it's tougher to pull off with drum fills for obvious reasons. It's used to great success all over this track, however.)"

This is a stripped down Ruby Haunt. The track proceeds over a couple of chords strummed over and over again on an acoustic guitar and a simple melody that constantly repeats in response. \"spinnin' out, runnin' away/felt way different yesterday,\" the lead sings lazily, the unadorned delivery starkly set against what those words actually mean.

The lyrics hint at exchanges which never take place, sentences which are never said, and loves which, requited or not, are never realized. There are no climaxes. No consummations. And all of this is brilliantly reflected by the track itself. The drums and strings plug along in non-stop, repetitive eighth-notes, and the vocals never rise above the place where they begin.
