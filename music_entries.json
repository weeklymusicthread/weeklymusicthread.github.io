It should be kind of a mess of a track, with lots of heavy synth, drum machines, tons of reverb, misplaced horns, and a borderline hip hop/spoken word chorus, but all of it comes together in a surprisingly pleasant way. This isn't a banger--it's not one that's going to carry you away immediately. It's got the vibes of Robbi Robb's \"In Time\" but without the power and meaningfulness.

It opens with a creaky, antique-y finger-picked acoustic guitar, a pretty resonant-sounding piano, and a whole lot of reverb. The track stretches and pops its' knuckles in ways that remind us of Marlon Williams' \"Strange Things\"--which you may recognize from the soundtrack of <i>Wild, Wild Country</i>--but without any of the creeping, old-timey eerieness of that track.
