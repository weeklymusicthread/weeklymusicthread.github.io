This is fun, energetic, sad chick pop punk that sounds like a threesome between Beach Bunny (aka Coastal Rabbits), Sincere Engineer (aka Heartfelt Architect), and Snarls (good luck on that one), all of whom have graced places atop the WMT in weeks past.",

            "Kitten are stars of the WMT. \"Memphis\" (not to mention its acoustic follow-up) remains one of the best and most infectious songs we've ever had the privilege to cover, and the group took a turn towards <i>la resistance</i> with the COVID-era herd immunity anthem \"My House.\" (The cover art to that single depicted a nude demented looking version of the group's lead singer stuffed into a miniature-sized house and the lyrics explained  that \"I'm watchin the world freakin out from my couch/Don't know what they're talkin about in my house/I wanna have fun again, I wanna go out/But they told me to stay in my house.\") Now, Kitten continue their turn toward far-right extremism with another banger entitled \"What Year Are We In,\" which talks about the hopeless nature of protests, Zoom parties, and getting pissed off over conspiracy theories.",

There are some synthy keys and horns, not to mention a drum machine, that make the whole thing sound like an updated '80s throwback, which fits in well with the name and theme. There are other parts of the track that remind one of Madness (and, of course, \"[Their] House\"). In the end, one of the things that really interests us about Kitten is that, of the four tracks of theirs which have made it onto the WMT, they're all bangers, but they all sound totally different"

            "Well, in 2005, they released in album called <i>Live it Out</i>, which opened with a track called \"Empty,\" which we've never heard before. We bring this up because, recently, they released an acoustic version of this song which came across our desk. \"Empty (Dirt Road),\" as this version is called, is pretty nice. It opens with a creaky, antique-y finger-picked acoustic guitar, a pretty resonant-sounding piano, and a whole lot of reverb. The track stretches and pops its' knuckles in ways that remind us of Marlon Williams' \"Strange Things\"--which you may recognize from the soundtrack of <i>Wild, Wild Country</i>--but without any of the creeping, old-timey eerieness of that track. Instead, what we've got here is melancholy, almost like Williams meets Jewel meets, at times, The Weakerthans.",
            "One of the things we like about this song is how long it lasts. It feels almost oppressive--it just goes on and on, and eventually resigns itself to its final, unbelieving refrain: \"I'm so glad I'm an island now\" [via Paul Simon and Garth Brooks]."

            "Because Phoebe Bridgers is one of our favorite young artists, anything to which her name is attached is of immediate interest to us. In 2019, Bridgers collab'd with The National's Matt Berninger to record a track called \"Walking on a String.\" They released two versions of the track--the original and the "alt version." The first one is a little more Berninger-forward, while the alt version is more Bridgers-forward, and, since we like Phoebe Bridgers more than we like The National, the alt version is our version of choice. It really sounds like it could have been a hidden track on 2018's <i>Stranger in the Alps</i>. (If, by some unfortunate turn of events you haven't yet experienced <i>SITA</i>, you've got something great coming. It's a solid listen-through, but \"Motion Sickness\" and \"Scott Street\" are early Stan Doubts.)"

It's basically a single guitar riff extended to about 3 or 4 minutes and length and constantly recycled and reinterpreted according to different genres, techniques, and tempos. Think of it as an organic \"Grape Soda.\"",
